           First, we'll need to install [BAML](https://github.com/boundaryml/baml)
           which is a tool for prompting and structured outputs.
        command: |
          !pip install baml-py
      - text: "Initialize BAML"
        command: |
          !baml-cli init
      - text: "Remove default resume.baml"
        command: |
          !rm baml_src/resume.baml
      - text: "Add our starter agent, a single baml prompt that we'll build on"
        file: {src: ./walkthrough/01-agent.baml, dest: baml_src/agent.baml}
      - text: "Generate BAML client code"
        command: |
          !baml-cli generate
      - text: "Enable BAML logging for this section"
        command: |
          export BAML_LOG=debug

      - text: "update our main.py to use the CLI"
        file: {src: ./walkthrough/01-main.py}
      - text: |
          try it out
