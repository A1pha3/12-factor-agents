okay but we have complications - colab can’t show baml files, i have hacked a few workaround to make this work, i need you to distill out all the changes that would need to happen in the logic flow from walkthrough.yaml to translate the steps so far into baml notebook - off the top of my head:

1) for each ts file, translate to python and drop in the walkthrough folder (claude will do this)
1b) update walkthrough.yaml to point to the python instead of ts file, lead the baml files unchanged
2) we won’t build section-by-section, we’ll build just one big notebook file (similar to the one-big-walkthrough-md target provided by the typescript library)
3) for each text section, add a markdown cell
4) for each code cell, add the full python file from the walkthrough, so that running the code cell will refresh and update any function definitions
5) rather than separate python files, we'll just update the function definitions in the notebook as we go - you might have to get creative / clever in just redefining what we used, and rather than commands to run each cell, you'll want two cells: 1 to update the function, and 1 to re-run the main() function (note: THIS is the part i'm the most unsure of and we might need to adjust the approach as we go!)
6) for each baml file, follow the example in the notebook, fetching the file from the public github url and printing it with cat
6b) if you need to update a baml file for some reason, i will need to push it to the public github repo
7) note that there may be some hackery where we need to re-import the baml_client after changing the baml sources!


other information - i have an example in the hack/ folder of a notebook that has everything working end to end for a subset of chapter 1, including setting secrets, installing/generating baml in a clean reusable way, fetching and displaying baml files

note that the implementation plan will need ways to run/verify the notebook after ever implementation change, so the implementation flow will be

1) make a change to the walkthrough.yaml OR make a change to hack/walkthroughgen_py.py
2) run the walkthroughgen_py.py script to generate the notebook
3) run the notebook to test that it works
3) read the notebook file and check for errors and that the outputs are expected

you will evolve each thing in parallel, targeting finishing a complete chapter in both the walkthrough.yaml and the walkthroughgen_py.py script before proceeding the the next chapter

### important notes
- There is a reference walkthrough from the typescript version in walkthrough-reference.yaml, which you can use to convert one chapter at a time
- `file: ` objects in the python / ipynb target will not have a dest, just a src

### before you start researching

first - review that plan, does it make sense? as you are researching, know that there will be things that I missed and that need to be adjusted in the plan

Ask any questions you have now before you start please.
