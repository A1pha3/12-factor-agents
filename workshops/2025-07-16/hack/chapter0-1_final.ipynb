    "## What is BAML?\n",
    "\n",
    "BAML (Boundary Markup Language) is a domain-specific language designed to help developers build reliable AI workflows and agents. Created by [BoundaryML](https://www.boundaryml.com/) (a Y Combinator W23 company), BAML adds the engineering to prompt engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why BAML?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type-safe outputs**: Get fully type-safe outputs from LLMs, even when streaming\n",
    "- **Language agnostic**: Works with Python, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, and more\n",
    "- **LLM agnostic**: Works with any LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)\n",
    "- **Better performance**: State-of-the-art structured outputs that outperform even OpenAI's native function calling\n",
    "- **Developer-friendly**: Native VSCode extension with syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and interactive playground\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learn More\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📚 [Official Documentation](https://docs.boundaryml.com/home)\n",

    "\n",
    "BAML turns prompt engineering into schema engineering, where you focus on defining the structure of your data rather than wrestling with prompts. This approach leads to more reliable and maintainable AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on Developer Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "BAML works much better in VS Code with their official extension, which provides syntax highlighting, autocomplete, inline testing, and an interactive playground. However, for this notebook tutorial, we'll work with BAML files directly without the enhanced IDE features.\n",
